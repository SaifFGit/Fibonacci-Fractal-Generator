# Fibonacci Fractal Generator

The program generates Fibonacci fractals from n values of 30 to 100 within a 2 to 20 minute time interval. The fractals are stored and represented as bitmap images in order to preserve high resolution image quality. Given a user's specified image width, height, and fibonacci fractal start and end points, the program will accurately depict the fractals as specificed.
